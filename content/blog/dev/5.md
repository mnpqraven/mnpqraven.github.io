# 2 weeks into Rust
So I've been learning Rust for a bit as per the previous blog post, and I did
say that I really was struggling, that doesn't change. I still struggle with
the Rust's ecosystem but now I really feel really rewarded when I understand
the problem correctly. To be more precise, one of the problem that I had was
the Trait and Option/Result type system, and at first since this is the first
time I see this kind of system, it really took me a long time to warp my head
around.

But that's the hardest part of the learning curve. When you understand the core
issue, it's really hard to make mistake just because of how strict the Rust's
type system is fundamentally. I feel like I have a much better control of my
code when I understand the part of said system in Rust compared to any other
programming language I've learned.
